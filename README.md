## Overview

What began as a simple desire for a transport case for a 3D printer has evolved into an extensive project. The result is a flexible FlightCase Designer. This project has somewhat "gone off the rails", and now includes a customizable openSCAD for visualization, as well as an HTML page for generating shopping lists, calculating cut lengths, and determining external dimensions.

## Features:

- **Intuitive Customization**: Adjust wall thickness and internal dimensions to suit various applications.
- **Web-based Planning**: HTML/Javascript tool designed for user-friendly FlightCase planning.
- **Detailed Visualization**: Customizable openSCAD file for in-depth visual representation.
- **Shopping Assistant**: Automatically creates a shopping list for your project.
- **Precise Measurements**: Calculates external dimensions based on your inputs.
- **Waste Reduction**: Provides expert recommendations on dividing and cutting aluminum profiles to ensure minimal waste.

## Design Notes

- **Material Thickness**: The design is currently tailored for Adam Hall profiles.
- **Additional Components**: Corners, locks, and sealing profiles are not included in this version, but can be added as needed.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Set Your Dimensions
Open the [HTML/Javascript tool](https://niederschelden.github.io/flightcaseplaner/) and adjust the internal dimensions to fit your needs.

### Step 2: Material and Profile Adjustments
Set your preferred material thickness. Additionally, make any necessary adjustments to the aluminum profile.

### Step 3: Advanced Customization (Optional)
For those familiar with OpenSCAD: Download the OpenSCAD files from this repository and manually change values in the declaration section for more detailed visualization.

### Step 4: Build Your FlightCase
Once you've set everything up, it's time to get building. Have fun!
