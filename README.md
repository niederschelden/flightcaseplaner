[![Thingiverse](https://img.shields.io/badge/Available_on-Thingiverse-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6172123)

## Overview

What began as a simple desire for a transport case for a 3D printer has evolved into an extensive project. The result is a flexible FlightCase Designer. This project has somewhat "gone off the rails", and now includes a customizable openSCAD for visualization, as well as an HTML page for generating shopping lists, calculating cut lengths, and determining external dimensions.

**Features**:
- Adjustable wall thickness, height, width, and length.
- HTML/Javascript tool for intuitive FlightCase planning.
- Customizable internal dimensions for a variety of applications.

## Design Notes

- **Material Thickness**: The design is currently tailored for Adam Hall profiles.
- **Additional Components**: Corners, locks, and sealing profiles are not included in this version, but can be added as needed.

## How to Use

1. Download the openSCAD files for visualization.
2. Open the HTML/Javascript tool and adjust the internal dimensions to your needs.
3. Set the desired material thickness and make any necessary adjustments to the aluminum profile.
4. Generate your shopping list.
5. Build your customized FlightCase.
