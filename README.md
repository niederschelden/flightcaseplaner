[![Thingiverse](https://img.shields.io/badge/Available_on-Thingiverse-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6172123)

## Overview

What began as a simple desire for a transport case for a 3D printer has evolved into an extensive project. The result is a flexible FlightCase Designer. This project has somewhat "gone off the rails", and now includes a customizable openSCAD for visualization, as well as an HTML page for generating shopping lists, calculating cut lengths, and determining external dimensions.

**Features**:
- Adjustable wall thickness, height, width, and length.
- HTML/Javascript tool for intuitive FlightCase planning.
- Customizable internal dimensions for a variety of applications.

## Design Notes

- **Material Thickness**: The design is currently tailored for Adam Hall profiles.
- **Additional Components**: Corners, locks, and sealing profiles are not included in this version, but can be added as needed.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Set Your Dimensions
Open the [HTML/Javascript tool](https://niederschelden.github.io/flightcaseplaner/) and adjust the internal dimensions to fit your needs.

### Step 2: Material and Profile Adjustments
Set your preferred material thickness. Additionally, make any necessary adjustments to the aluminum profile.

### Step 3: Advanced Customization (Optional)
For those familiar with OpenSCAD: Download the OpenSCAD files from this repository and manually change values in the declaration section for more detailed visualization.

### Step 4: Build Your FlightCase
With all parameters set, proceed to build your customized FlightCase. Happy building!
